EasyStar.js Pathfinder Plugin for Phaser
===========================================================

Plugin for Phaser (http://phaser.io) which includes Easystar.js

> Example at master branch requires Phaser 2.0. Plugin should work with both.
> If you are using Phaser 1.1.x, please checkout V0.1.1: https://github.com/appsbu-de/phaser_plugin_pathfinding/tree/V0.1.1

## Plugin
The plugin is located in `bin`. Since 0.2.0 the plugin bundles Easystar (thanks to [meltuhamy](https://github.com/meltuhamy)!). If you want to build the plugin on your own, use [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

## Usage

Please take a look at `index.html` everything is set up there and a crappy demo is available.
This plugin relies on EasyStar.js which is bundle since V0.2.0
